  <h1> Gary's money tips - I'm not saying this is gonna make you money, might even lose you money but this is what I think
    is good and easy to do when you're in your early 20s </h1>

  <h2> Key points to know </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Time value of money </li>
    <li> Risk vs return tradeoff </li>
    <li> In the long run, the market rises </li>
    <li> Follow the crowd, even experts generally do worse than the crowd in the long run </li>
  </ul>
  <h2> Priorities for money </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Always pay off highest interest rate debt first* </li>
    <li> Then keep what you need for day to day living </li>
    <li> Only then should you invest - this is because paying off debt can be thought of as an investment that returns that interest rate guaranteed </li>
    <li> * - unless you have some investment device such as employer matching or the like that guarantees some return greater than the highest debt interest rate. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2> Day to day </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Get a credit card with some cash back - literally from anywhere, they're all pretty similar, but i personally have a card that has a solid rate across the board, and then a card that has an especially high rate for certain categories. </li>
    <ul>
      <li> If you don't have a credit score in the US, start building one with discover (and ask me for a referral code for
        a free $50) </li>
    </ul>
    <li> Credit score is voodoo, but some things you can do to not make it horrible </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Pay off your card (obviously) in full and on time - i like paying off the amount owing intermittently, not just statements; since the balance at the statement is whats reported </li>
      <li> Don't close your oldest credit card </li>
      <li> Get borrowell and/or credit karma for free credit score tracking </li>
    </ul>
    <li> Keep an emergency fund (couple thousand, idk, the amount should be something you'd be comfortable living off of
      for a month if literally your parents disowned you and you had no job) and spending money in an EQ bank savings account - gives
      2.3% interest, which is way better than other interest you'll be getting at your bank, wealthsimple also
      has a savings account with a 1.95% interest </li>
    <li> in america, wealthfront now has a savings account with 2.24% and thats what i use </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Extra helpful if you do a monthly budget which is basically setting out amounts of money you're gonna spend on
        certain areas, tracking what you spend in the areas, and then readjusting either the budget, or your behaviour based
        on whether or not you reach the budgetted amounts - I'm not too strict on this - its important to note, that even if you have allocations in your budget, doesnt mean you should strive to spend to that amount every month </li>
      <li> EQ bank gives you some etransfers for free so for daily spending, use your credit card, and then whenever you
        want to pay your bill, send money from EQ </li>
      <li> Alternatively, EQ bank interest is calculated on your month ends balance so you could keep money in your regular
        checking account and the week before the last day of the month, transfer your money into EQ, grab the interest, and
        etransfer it back </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h2> Invest the rest of your money </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Picking individual stocks is an easy way to lose money if you don't do actual research or dont know what youre doing. i dont know what im doing so i do the following:</li>
    <li> Best bet is just to buy a mix of ETFs</li>
    <ul>
      <li> You can usually open a brokerage account with your standard bank or use robinhood/wealthsimple trade, or just have a roboadvisor do this for you </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Robinhood/wealthsimple trade offers no fees trading, whereas
          most brokerage accounts at banks charge you some commission per trade. </li>
      </ul>
      <li> If you're picking your own, pick an allocation of fixed income etfs, then equity etfs. I personally aim for around 20% fixed, 80% equity. Idk who came up with this, but its pretty common to hear that you should use your age as the percent held in fixed income. </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Just go on vanguard or blackrock (ishares) or bmo also has some and filter or search for the etfs that you want and then buy that ticker </li>
        <li> Diversify the stock ETFs you pick </li>
        <ul>
          <li> Your biggest position should just be in a large index, like an S&P 500 tracking ETF </li>
          <li> note that the S&P 500 is cap weighted and has 500 companies listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ, vs the Dow which is stupidly price weighted and only has 30 or 60 companies so youre getting less diversification and an irrelevant weighting scheme since price depends on the number of shares which is arbitrarily set by companies. the NASDAQ 100 is only NASDAQ and only 100 companies. So thats why S&P 500 </li>
          <li> Then grab some different geographies - emerging markets, china, europe, etc... </li>
          <li> Then grab some different industries - healthcare, tech, industrial, etc... </li>
        </ul>
        <li> Rbalancing around once a year is probably good practice. Rebalancing is just
          selling and buying things to get back to the desired percentages for the different types of assets I mentioned
          (fixed income (i use bond etfs as a proxy) and stocks are the main ones) </li>
      </ul>
      <li> If you're going with a robo, just make your portfolio the risk level option offered that matches with what you need (i think im 8 or 9 on wealthsimple and wealthfront) </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Also there's some fees on robos, but less than a mutul fund still </li>
        <li> There are some ways you can get more managed for free - usually referring friends </li>
        <ul>
          <li> So for Canada, use my code for wealthsimple (0.5% fee) pls https://wealthsimple.com/invite/183W4A </li>
          <li> Or if you're in the US, wealthfront (0.25%) has even lower fees than wealthsimple https://wlth.fr/2NlJ5pr
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li> Whatever option you pick you should know about some registered accounts </li>
    <ul>
      <li> These are accounts that house your investments, they aren't investments themselves </li>
      <li> TFSA (Canada) </li>
      <ul>
        <li> You don't get taxed on gains </li>
        <li> There's a limit to how much you can contribute (deposit) to a TFSA every year </li>
        <li> But the limit has accumulated ever since you were 18 </li>
        <li> Basically, you can open a TFSA (blank) account, where the blank is a regular savings account, a brokerage (stock
          trading) account, and wealthsimple also gives you the option to make an account you have with them a tfsa. Then
          these accounts act the same as if it wasnt a tfsa except for the contribution restrictions and tax savings </li>
        <li> you can check your limit on cra my account </li>
      </ul>
      <li> The next three are "retirement" accounts. It's obviously best to start as soon as possible, but because they are
        retirement accounts, there's usually some restricitons on withdrawing money, but im not too familiar. </li>
      <li> Rrsp (Canada) </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Limit is 18% of your previous years income to a maximum of 26230 </li>
        <li> Limit accumulates - you can check this limit on cra my account</li>
        <li> The idea behind these is that youll get taxed when you withdraw, and you wont get taxed on any income you put into these accounts. So since your retirement income is basically just what you withdraw from your retirement accounts, youll be at a lower tax bracket than now when youre still making income. So if you put money in now, youre saving taxes dependent on the difference in tax bracket </li>
      </ul>
      <li> Roth IRA (US) </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Limit is 5.5k each year but it doesn't accumulate </li>
        <li> Can't withdraw gains until you're old (59.5 I think) </li>
      </ul>
      <li> 401K (US, only through employer) </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Max out whatever your employer matches (think of it as basically an insta 100% ROI) </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h2> Other shit </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Drop and carrot are okay for getting rewards points - I've gotten 1k scene points, some air miles, and probably
      around $30 worth of drop points </li>
    <ul>
      <li> carrot is not as good anymore since you cant get points for daily steps like you used to be able to </li>
      <li> But don't let drop make you spend more </li>
      <li> use my referral codes for this shit </li>
      <ul>
        <li> drop - 7nzyb </li>
        <li> carrot - garys1113 </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
