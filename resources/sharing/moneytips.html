  <h1> Gary's money tips - I'm not saying this is gonna make you money, might even lose you money but this is what I think
    is good and easy to do when you're in your early 20s </h1>

  <h2> Key points to know </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Time value of money </li>
    <li> Risk vs return tradeoff </li>
    <li> In the long run, the market rises </li>
  </ul>
  <h2> Priorities for money </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Always pay off debt first </li>
    <li> Then keep what you need for day to day living </li>
    <li> Then you can invest </li>
  </ul>
  <h2> Day to day </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Get a credit card with some cash back - literally from anywhere, they're all pretty similar </li>
    <ul>
      <li> If you don't have a credit score in the US, start building one with discover (and ask me for a referral code for
        a free $50) </li>
    </ul>
    <li> Credit score is voodoo, but some things you can do to not make it horrible </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Pay off your card (obviously) in full and on time </li>
      <li> Don't close your oldest credit card </li>
      <li> Get borrowell and/or credit karma for free credit score tracking </li>
    </ul>
    <li> Keep an emergency fund (couple thousand, idk, the amount should be something you'd be comfortable living off of
      for a month if your parents disowned you and you had no job) and spending money in an EQ bank savings account - gives
      2.3% interest, which is way better than other shit.shit% interest you'll be getting at your bank, wealthsimple also
      has a savings account with a 1.95% interest </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Extra helpful if you do a monthly budget which is basically setting out amounts of money you're gonna spend on
        certain areas, tracking what you spend in the areas, and then readjusting either the budget, or your behaviour based
        on whether or not you reach the budgetted amounts - but I don't do this </li>
      <li> EQ bank gives you some etransfers for free so for daily spending, use your credit card, and then whenever you
        want to pay your bill, send money from EQ </li>
      <li> Alternatively, EQ bank interest is calculated on your month ends balance so you could keep money in your regular
        checking account and the week before the last day of the month, transfer your money into EQ, grab the interest, and
        etransfer it back </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h2> Invest the rest of your money </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Picking individual stocks is an easy way to lose money if you don't do actual research, if you don't want to do
      much work, just do what I recommend below (disclaimer: I don't completely listen to my own advice and I do some individual
      stock picking, but individual stocks are only 7% of my total holdings) </li>
    <li> There's so many guides out there that can help (also a lot out there that won't help) - I've never actually really
      looked at any but I've heard the couch potato portfolio is good?? Maybe give it a search </li>
    <li> Best bet is just to buy a mix of ETFs - mutual funds take off absurd fees and don't really beat the market </li>
    <ul>
      <li> You can open a brokerage account with your standard big 5 bank, or just have a robo do this for you </li>
      <ul>
        <li> A better option is robinhood (US only) if you can open an account. Robinhood offers no fees trading, whereas
          most brokerage accounts at banks charge you $10 per trade. Chase (again US only) just announced they're gonna offer
          100 no fee trades to people on their platform for the first year. After the first year, if you have 15k in Chase
          accounts, you keep getting the 100 free trades which is more than enough for more passive investing, which is what
          I'm recommending anyways. </li>
      </ul>
      <li> If you're picking your own, an allocation of 5% bond ETFs, 5% gold ETFs (if you want that extra security, but
        this isn't really needed), the rest in stock ETFs is probably good </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Just go on vanguard or blackrock (ishares) or bmo also has some and filter or search for what you want - they'll
          have it </li>
        <li> I'm recommending mostly stock because you're young, you should have a high risk tolerance </li>
        <li> Diversify the stock ETFs you pick </li>
        <ul>
          <li> Your biggest position should just be in an index, like an S&P 500 tracking ETF </li>
          <li> Then grab some different geographies - emerging markets is where the most growth and also the most risk is
          </li>
          <li> Then grab some different industries </li>
        </ul>
        <li> You don't need to do this but rebalancing around once a year is probably good practice. Rebalancing is just
          selling and buying things to get back to the desired percentages for the different types of assets I mentioned
          (bonds and stocks are the main ones) </li>
      </ul>
      <li> If you're going with a robo, just make your portfolio the riskiest option that the robo offers </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Also there's some fees, much less than a mutul fund still </li>
        <li> There are some ways you can get more managed for free - usually referring friends </li>
        <ul>
          <li> So for Canada, use my code for wealthsimple (0.5% fee) pls https://wealthsimple.com/invite/183W4A </li>
          <li> Or if you're in the US, wealthfront (0.25%) has even lower fees than wealthsimple https://wlth.fr/2NlJ5pr
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li> Whatever option you pick you should know about some registered accounts </li>
    <ul>
      <li> These are accounts that house your investments, they aren't investments themselves </li>
      <li> TFSA (Canada) </li>
      <ul>
        <li> You don't get taxed on gains </li>
        <li> There's a limit to how much you can contribute (deposit) to a TFSA every year </li>
        <li> But the limit has accumulated ever since you were 18 </li>
        <li> Basically, you can open a TFSA (blank) account, where the blank is a regular savings account, a brokerage (stock
          trading) account, and wealthsimple also gives you the option to make an account you have with them a tfsa. Then
          these accounts act the same as if it wasnt a tfsa except for the contribution restrictions and tax savings </li>
        <li> Check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax-Free_Savings_Account#Contribution_room </li>
      </ul>
      <li> The next three are "retirement" accounts. It's obviously best to start as soon as possible, and because they are
        retirement accounts, there's usually some restricitons that pretty much lock the money or some of the money away,
        inaccessible to you for long term (until retirement age) on when you can withdraw or make the most benefit from these.
        I'm also not that familiar with these </li>
      <li> Rrsp (Canada) </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Limit is 18% of your previous years income to a maximum of 26230 </li>
        <li> Limit accumulates </li>
      </ul>
      <li> Roth IRA (US) </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Limit is 5.5k each year but it doesn't accumulate </li>
        <li> Can't withdraw gains until you're old (59.5 I think) </li>
      </ul>
      <li> 401K (US, only through employer) </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Max out whatever your employer matches (think of it as basically an insta 100% ROI) </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h2> Other shit </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Drop and carrot are okay for getting rewards points - I've gotten 1k scene points, some air miles, and probably
      around $30 worth of drop points from not changing my behaviour at all </li>
    <ul>
      <li> But don't let drop make you spend more </li>
      <li> use my referral codes for this shit </li>
      <ul>
        <li> drop - 7nzyb </li>
        <li> carrot - garys1113 </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
