  <h1>Breaking into tech - Gary's perspective, this is real rough, just a collection of thoughts. Also disclaimer: ive only
    ever recruited for SWE</h1>

  <h2>3 (Main) Tracks - SWE, PM, BIZ</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>SWEs are the ones who code, but if you think its just grinding out code, thats a bit of a misconception. engineers
      can be as involved as they want in designing and scoping projects, and basically own the technical side of a product
      from design to implementation to launch to maintenance. Growth for SWEs is all the SWE levels, then either to a SWE
      manager, or if they want to stay technical something like a distinguished engineer/architect</li>
    <li>PMs. If you've heard PMs are mini ceos, i think thats right, but the mininess can be really small, like people owning
      a single dropdown menu (at least at the intern levels). PMs are in a lot of meetings, but get to meet clients. Some
      PM work is about researching what makes a product good, like what are KPIs, some is about designing (wireframing),
      some is about monitoring dashboards and reporting, some is about working with engineers</li>
    <li>BIZ. a bunch of different shit, with a big range of what they do. I cant speak much to these since i havent looked
      into them that much</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>SWE</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>first of all if youre looking for an internship, already good job, work experience is really the best way to learn
      how to be an actual SWE, and also any internship helps in the job search</li>
    <li>second you should know, neither western nor ivey will be that much of a help (in terms of career management support,
      brand name, courses, etc...)</li>
    <li>timeframe for us companies is basically end of summer (aug) to february-ish</li>
    <li>canadian companies basically all the way to april, wide range for when they start accepting applications</li>
    <li>the process for most places considering youre at western and not a target school is - sometimes a coding challenge,
      then technical phone screen, then final rounds either 3ish on site or consecutive phone interviews on one day</li>
    <li>my timleine for stuff is generally start prepping at the start of august, apply/reach out in september, interview
      in october. this year, i prepped earlier because of return offer interviews, applied and reached out in august, and
      am interviewing August-september</li>
    <h3>resume stuff</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>get it reviewed by as many people as possible - good for formatting, also some things might be confusing to everyone
        except for yourself</li>
      <li>keep it under one page</li>
      <li>descriptions of stuff should be technical but not too technical, for work experience, i like to have the business
        reason then how it was done, and obviously quantifying if possible (ie. Built X feature that allowed customers to
        do Y using Z technology, which increased A metric by B quantity.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>sending out the resume</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>reaching out on email is best, then linked in, then online portal applications are still useful</li>
      <li>you might get hackerrank challenges, i've only gotten past the hackerrank round once, but from that time i passed,
        i think it's important that it not only passes all the tests, but also is clean code, no redundant parts, considers
        things like good design</li>
      <li>best way ive found has been to reach out to someone you know and ask for just a recruiter email, then email the
        recruiter directly with an introduction, why you think youre qualified, and your resume, not wasting the person you
        know's time or pressuring them for more. the recruiters job is to correspond with potential candidates so let them
        do that with you. </li>
      <li>I’ve found other interns work the best because they just give you their recruiter’s email</li>
      <li>other way is to reach out to someone you know and ask them to push your resume through to a hiring manager, etc...
        Unless you know this person really well and they actually are comfortable and have the rank/seniority to have a say
        in hiring decisions, i personally don't think this works well</li>
      <li>if you dont know the person that well, you can just ask for a referral as well, which is almost at the level of
        an online app, but probably a bit helpful</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>interview stuff</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>ctci, leetcode, if you can get a list of questions by company just going through the questions asked by a big company
        is probably comprehensive in terms of topic coverage</li>
      <li>codesignals topic summaries</li>
      <li>https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-algorithms-in-interview-questions/</li>
      <li><a href="-swequestions.html">questions ive gotten</a> (as of aug 2018)</li>
      <li>do whatever works for you but i personally dont find mocking with others that helpful but i see that it does have
        some benefits, especially if you want to work on talkign questions out</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h2>PM</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>afaik, similar process and timeline as swe for getting an interview (applying online, reaching out), main difference
      is the interview</li>
    <li>another difference is what backgroudn companies look for - id say strengths/previous experience in marketing, consulting,
      swe are all important</li>
    <li>there are fewer companies that hire pm interns/new grads, also fewer positions at these companies (ratio of pms to
      swes is probably 1:50 on average maybe)</li>
    <li>from what ive heard theres 5/6 main question types, i think these are also described in cracking the pm which is
      a good resource</li>
    <ul>
      <li>market sizing/estimation (ie. how many golf balls fit in a bus)</li>
      <li>mini case/what would you do (not sure what exactly these are like)</li>
      <li>basic technical questions (leetcode easy probably)</li>
      <li>product based questions (ie design X for Y customer segment, whats your favourtie thing about Z product and why)</li>
      <li>behavioural/resume based questions (tell me about a time...)</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h2>BIZ</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>breakinto.tech is a good resource</li>
    <li>timeframe is generally a bit later - probably starts around january and goes until april</li>
    <li>There’s not a well defined processes for non tech roles, even at larger companies so a lot of the applying will be
      informal reaching out and proving that you’re worth it </li>
    <li>some of what i said about reaching out in the SWE section is probably relevant</li>
    <li>When you reach out to the recruiter I’ve heard people find success by preparing something extra that proves their
      interest and ability, like a slide deck analyzing potential business problems and how to solve them. Then basically
      ask the recruiter for info on the recruiting process for the role you’re interested in and ask if you can be considered.
    </li>
    <li>Not sure what interviews are like and because its such a wide variety, I assume that its pretty similar to the same
      role at a non tech company (for things like marketing) but it wouldnt hurt to be following tech news, and be able to
      talk about something tech related you’re interested in to some level of depth (not sure how technical). </li>
    <li>Ive heard bizops roles sometimes require sql</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Other stuff worth mentioning</h2>
  <h3>What distinguishes companies</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>size - basically a balance between how much impact you can have, vs how much resources you can have behind you, also
      some cultural things, but its hard to really explain without experiencing it. here’s definitely good and bad things
      about both smaller and bigger companies with balancing how much resources you have behind you vs how much autonomy
      you have vs how fast thigns get done</li>
    <li>what they're working on - i think the main difference is between companies that are b2c vs b2b, there is a difference
      in how they work, what they're priorities are, how much impact you can have etc...</li>
    <li>this one is stupid to care about but I do think its somewhat important, but prestige - working at a well known place
      will help you launch your career, and id say theres tiers for this even within the big ass companies and unicorns</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The tech recruiting environement, more ivey and western specific</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>western tech alumni is a great program for prepping for technical stuff</li>
    <li>alumni are varying levels of helpful when reaching out</li>
    <li>on campus, i think people are generally pretty supportive and helpful</li>
    <li>less formal recruiting pipeline than things like finance and consulting</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>General tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Set a goal for an absurd number of rejections. This can shift your perspective and hopefully encourage you to apply everywhere which is sometimes what is needed since a lot of recruiting unfortunately is based on luck. I didnt formally structure this out, but I had a tracker when I was trying to break into the states for an internship and I would always semi-brag about how many rejections i had so far in group chats with my friends. My final count was 82 application; out of those, i had 9 move on to a first round. Out of those 9, 4 of them just cut me after a hackerank type coding screen (which barely counts as a first round). Of the other 5, 1 cut me after the first phone round, so I had a lot of rejection.</li>
  </ul>
